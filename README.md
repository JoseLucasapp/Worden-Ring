## 📖 About the Project

**Worden Ring** is a word game inspired by the classic [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), but set in the dark and challenging universe of **Elden Ring**.

Players must guess hidden words, names of bosses, locations, weapons, spells, and secrets of the Lands Between, all drawn directly from the [**Elden Ring Fans API**](https://eldenring.fanapis.com/).

⚔️ Harder than Elden Ring itself: you’ll need more than **99 Intelligence**, beyond the game’s very limit.


## ✨ Features

* 🌍 Words sourced from the [**Elden Ring Fans API**](https://eldenring.fanapis.com/)
