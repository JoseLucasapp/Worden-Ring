                            <p><strong>Worden Ring</strong> was forged in August 2025 by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jlucasgf/">José Lucas</a> a devoted wanderer of both <strong>Elden Ring</strong> and <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html'>Wordle</a>.
                                A twisted reflection of Wordle, reborn within the Lands Between.</p>

                            <p>This trial surpasses even the mightiest of foes.
                                To endure, one must wield knowledge beyond mortal bounds, more than <strong>99 Intelligence</strong>, shattering the very limits set by Elden Ring itself. If you found a bug, it's not a bug, it's a feature that makes the game hard</p>

                            <p>Every word is drawn from the deep lore of the <a href='https://eldenring.fanapis.com/'>Elden Ring Fans API</a>: the names of bosses, relics, weapons, and legends scattered throughout the realm.</p>

                            <p>No personal data is taken. No cookies. No tracking.
                                Only your will… and your guesses… shall determine your fate.</p>

                            <p style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>V 0.0.3</p>

                        </div>

                            <h2>Help</h2>

                            <p>You got <strong>7 chances</strong> to uncover the hidden word from the world of <strong>Elden Ring</strong>: bosses, npcs, locations, items, weapons, or everything.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><div></div> Correct letter & spot</li>
                                <li><div></div> Letter exists, wrong place</li>
                                <li><div></div> Letter not in word</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Beware: <br /><strong style={{ fontSize: "32px" }}>␣</strong> = space inside the word.
                                <br />The apostrophe <strong>'</strong> is auto-filled for you.
                                (Yes, there are apostrophes, and yes, this is harder than <strong>Elden Ring</strong>!)</p>

                            <p>This trial is said to be harder than Elden Ring itself.
                                To prevail, you must wield patience, wit, and more than <strong>99 Intelligence</strong>.</p>

                            <p>May your guesses strike true, and may Grace guide your words.</p>
